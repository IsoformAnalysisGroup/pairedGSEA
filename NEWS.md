# pairedGSEA 1.13.1

## Bug fixes

* `paired_ora()`: the combined (paired) analysis now uses genes tested for
  both expression and splicing as its universe; previously genes without a
  splicing result were included. Missing paired results are now filled in
  the paired columns instead of overwriting the splicing relative risk and
  enrichment score. Affects paired ORA results since 1.1.0 (Bioconductor
  3.18); expression-only and splicing-only ORA are unchanged.
* `paired_diff()`: `test = "Wald"` no longer fails; the reduced model is
  only used for the likelihood ratio test.
* The reduced model for the likelihood ratio test now removes the group
  term by name instead of the first term of the design.
* `paired_diff()`: surrogate variable estimation is now seeded
  (`sva_seed`), so results are reproducible between runs.

## Changes

* `paired_diff()`: the number of automatically estimated surrogate
  variables is capped so that the model keeps enough residual degrees of
  freedom (`sva_min_residual_df`). An optional upper limit can be set with
  `sva_max_n`; when set, the number is also capped at the square root of the
  number of samples. An exact request (`sva_n`) stops with an informative
  error when it is unsafe instead of being reduced silently.
* `paired_diff()`: SVA diagnostics (requested, estimated and retained
  surrogate variables, residual degrees of freedom) are stored in
  `metadata(result)$pairedGSEA_sva`.
